# General Learning Resources
* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) AKA the Rust Book
* [Brown University's version of the Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu)
  * spruced up with visualisations and a whole lot of interactive quizzes, in particular IRT ownership and UB
* [Learn Rust with Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html)
  * A great way to delve deeper into the language's semantics, and a very fun read :-)
* [Learning Rust](https://quinedot.github.io/rust-learning/) by QuineDot
  * particularly helpful/enlightening on borrows/lifetimes and `dyn Trait`
* [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com)

# Hands-On Learning Resources
* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) (browser/playground-based)
  * best read in tandem with [QuineDot's Notes](https://github.com/QuineDot/rbe-notes)
* [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool) (local install)
* [100 Exercises To Learn Rust](https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/)
  * offers a gentle intro to systems programming concepts
  * longer, more life-like examples than Rustlings and RBE
  * covers tokio
* [Rust by Practice](https://practice.course.rs)
* [Exercism's Rust track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)

# Rust & Functional Programming (FP)
* Many of Rust's FP-supporting features and idiosyncracies are nicely outlined in:
  * [Is Rust functional?](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional/)
  * [Collect in Rust, traverse in Haskell and Scala](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/collect-rust-traverse-haskell-scala/)
  * [Rust for Haskell Developers](https://serokell.io/blog/rust-for-haskellers)

# Tools
* [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
  * very full-featured
     * tools incl. `Clippy`, `rustfmt`, `Miri` and macro expansion (nightly only)
     * supported output formats incl. asm, wasm and Rust's various IRs
     * only really lacks a REPL :-)
