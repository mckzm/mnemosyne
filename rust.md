# Learning Resources (General)
# Hands-On Resources to Learn Rust
* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) (browser/playground-based)
  * best read in tandem with [QuineDot's Notes](https://github.com/QuineDot/rbe-notes)
* [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool) (local install)
* [100 Exercises To Learn Rust](https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/)
  * offers a gentle intro to systems programming concepts
  * longer, more life-like examples than Rustlings and RBE
  * covers tokio

# Rust & Functional Programming (FP)
* Many of Rust's FP-supporting features and idiosyncracies are nicely outlined in:
  * [Is Rust functional?](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional/)
  * [Collect in Rust, traverse in Haskell and Scala](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/collect-rust-traverse-haskell-scala/)
  * [Rust for Haskell Developers](https://serokell.io/blog/rust-for-haskellers)
# Tools
* [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
  * very full-featured
     * tools incl. `Clippy`, `rustfmt`, `Miri` and macro expansion (nightly only)
     * supported output formats incl. asm, wasm and Rust's various IRs
     * only really lacks a REPL :-)
